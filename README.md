# Sentiment-Analysis-Chatbot-Using-NLP

**1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing**
  Dataset: Use a sentiment analysis dataset (like movie reviews, product reviews, or tweets).
  Cleaning the Data: Remove noise such as special characters, extra spaces, and stopwords using libraries like re and nltk.
  Tokenization: Break down text into smaller units (words or phrases).
  Vectorization: Convert text into numerical format using tools like CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer.
  Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
**2. Building the Sentiment Analysis Model**
Model Selection: Use a machine learning algorithm such as:
  I.Logistic Regression
  II.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  III.Naive Bayes
  **Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed data.
  **Evaluation**: Test the model using the testing set and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
**3. Chatbot Development**
  Logic: Integrate the sentiment analysis model into a chatbot framework. For example:
  Take user input.
  Analyze the sentiment of the input using the trained model.
  Respond with a message based on the sentiment (e.g., "positive," "negative," or "neutral").
  Functionality: Implement features like:
  Predefined responses.
  Handling multiple inputs.
  Dynamic responses for better interactivity.
**4. Web Application Development**
  Frontend: Design a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.
  Backend: Use Flask or another framework to:
  Handle routes (e.g., /, /chat).
  Process user inputs from the web interface.
  Return chatbot responses.
**5. Future Enhancements**
  Improve sentiment analysis by integrating more complex models like LSTMs or transformers (e.g., BERT).
  Enhance the chatbot's conversational abilities using NLP frameworks like Rasa or Dialogflow.
  Add multi-language support to reach a wider audience
